      "To fully correct an arbitrary two-port,  the device must be measured in two orientations, call these forward and reverse. In practice, this requires the operator to physically flip the device, or to have two identical devices fabricated, one in each orientation. In either case, both measurements are required before correction can occur. \n",

      "While in reality the device is being flipped, this is equivalent to leaving the device static, and flipping the entire VNA circuitry. If we represent two-port networks by their wave cascading matrices and the action of flipping by  $A\\rightarrow  \\bar{A} $, then the equivalence between flipping the device or switching a symmetrical VNA's state is expressed by\n",
